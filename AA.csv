508,Accountant,My fiancÃ© and I have been waiting for our flight to depart for 2hr now.  Our flight departure time changed 5 times and with no explanation.

511,Nothing like a patronizing customer service supervisor,"I had purchased some upgrade coupons in 2018 and tried to use them. I found out that because I was not a gold member I couldn't.
